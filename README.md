# 🌐 Website Development Workflow (React / Next.js / Astro / DRF)

> Streamlined freelance process for building modern websites with React, Next.js, Astro, or Django REST Framework.

---

## 1. 📨 Initial Client Contact

### Ask:
- What’s the goal of the website?
- Do you have content ready (text, images, logo)?
- Any reference sites or competitors?
- Do you need a blog, contact form, e-commerce, or admin panel?
- Do you have a preferred stack (or leave that to me)?
- Timeline + Budget?

---

## 2. 📋 Project Planning

- Define sitemap (pages, routes)
- Choose stack (e.g. Next.js for SSR, Astro for static, DRF if backend is needed)
- Finalize feature list (auth, CMS, API integration)
- Note responsiveness/mobile support

---

## 3. 🎨 Design Phase (Optional but Recommended)

- Create homepage mockup in Figma
- Get client approval before moving to dev

> You can use prebuilt UI kits (e.g., Tailwind UI, Flowbite)

---

## 4. 💵 Agreement + Payment

### Preferred Model:
- 30% upfront (before dev)
- 40% after halfway preview
- 30% on final delivery

Use a simple freelance agreement and invoice tool:
- Contract: Bonsai / Google Docs
- Payment: Payoneer / Wise / PayPal

---

## 5. 🛠 Development Workflow

### Frontend (React / Next.js / Astro):
- Create GitHub repo
- Set up Tailwind + ESLint + Prettier
- Deploy preview with Vercel/Netlify

### Backend (optional, with DRF):
- Set up DRF project
- Connect PostgreSQL
- Deploy with Railway/Render/Heroku

### Tips:
- Use `.env` for secrets
- Provide client a dev preview link early

---

## 6. 🔄 Client Review + Revisions

- Get feedback on staging URL
- Limit revisions (2 rounds suggested)
- Use a shared doc or task tracker (Notion/Trello)

---

## 7. 🚀 Final Delivery

### Deliverables:
- Live deployed site (on Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- GitHub repo or ZIP export
- Admin access (if CMS/backend)
- Deployment instructions (if applicable)

Optional:
- Client guide on updating text/images

---

## 8. 🧑‍💼 Aftercare & Support

Offer:
- Free support for 1–2 weeks
- Maintenance add-on (monthly or hourly)

---

## 9. 📈 Upsell Opportunities
